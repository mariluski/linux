    <h1>The linux kernel</h1>
    Linux is part of the GNU project.
    What diferenciates linux from the rest is that it is <strong>F</strong>ree and <strong>O</strong>pen <strong>S</strong>ource, meaning that everyone can see the code, contribute, redistribute and/or edit it and make their version.
